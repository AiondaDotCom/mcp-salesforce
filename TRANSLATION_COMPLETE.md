## Bug Fix: Path Resolution Issue ✅
**Issue:** During initial testing, the context learning tool failed with `ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/cache'`

**Root Cause:** The tool was using `process.cwd()` for path resolution, which pointed to the wrong directory when the MCP server was running.

**Solution:** Updated the path construction to use `__dirname` (derived from `import.meta.url`) like other tools in the project:
- ✅ Added proper ES module path resolution using `fileURLToPath`
- ✅ Changed from `process.cwd()` to `__dirname` based path construction
- ✅ Aligned with existing pattern used in `learn.js`

**Result:** Context file now correctly saves to `/Users/saf/dev/mcp-salesforce/cache/salesforce-context.json`
