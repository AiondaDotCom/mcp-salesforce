```
*Behind the scenes:*
```sql
SELECT Id, FirstName, LastName, Email, CreatedDate 
FROM Contact 
WHERE CreatedDate = THIS_MONTH 
ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC 
LIMIT 10
```

Find all contacts with gmail.com email addresses
```
*SOQL:*
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Email, Account.Name 
FROM Contact 
WHERE Email LIKE '%gmail.com'
```

### Advanced Queries

**Opportunities Closing This Quarter**
```
What opportunities are closing this quarter with amounts over $10,000?
```
*SOQL:*
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Amount, CloseDate, StageName, Account.Name 
FROM Opportunity 
WHERE CloseDate = THIS_QUARTER 
AND Amount > 10000 
ORDER BY Amount DESC
```

**Contacts Without Activities**
```
Find contacts who haven't been contacted in the last 30 days

Show me accounts with their related contacts and recent opportunities
```
*SOQL:*
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Industry, 
       (SELECT Id, Name, Email FROM Contacts LIMIT 5),
       (SELECT Id, Name, Amount FROM Opportunities 
        WHERE CreatedDate = THIS_YEAR LIMIT 3)
FROM Account 
WHERE Industry != null 
LIMIT 10
```

**Picklist Values**
```
What are the valid values for the Lead Status field?
```
*Describe Lead object and look for Status field picklist values*

**Relationship Fields**
```
What lookup fields does the Opportunity object have?
```
*Describe Opportunity to see reference fields*

## Complex Workflow Examples

### Data Migration Workflow

**1. Analyze Source Data**
```
Show me the structure of our Contact object to understand what fields I need to map
```

**2. Validate Required Fields**
```
What are the required fields for creating new Contacts?
```

**3. Create Test Records**
```
Create a test contact to validate our data mapping
```

**4. Bulk Query Existing Data**
```
SELECT Id, Email FROM Contact WHERE Email != null
```

### Data Quality Workflow

**1. Find Duplicate Accounts**
```sql
SELECT Name, COUNT(Id) 
FROM Account 
GROUP BY Name 
HAVING COUNT(Id) > 1
```

**2. Identify Missing Information**
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Email, Phone 
FROM Contact 
WHERE Email = null OR Phone = null
```

**3. Update Records with Missing Data**
```
Update the contacts found to have complete information
```

### Reporting Workflow

**1. Get Opportunity Pipeline**
```sql
SELECT StageName, COUNT(Id), SUM(Amount)
FROM Opportunity 
WHERE IsClosed = false
GROUP BY StageName
```

**2. Analyze Contact Engagement**
```sql
SELECT Account.Name, COUNT(Id) ContactCount
FROM Contact 
WHERE LastActivityDate >= LAST_N_DAYS:30
GROUP BY Account.Name
ORDER BY ContactCount DESC
```

**3. Track Recent Activities**
```sql
SELECT Subject, ActivityDate, Who.Name
FROM Task 
WHERE ActivityDate = TODAY
```

## Best Practices

### Query Optimization

**Use Selective Filters**
```sql
-- Good: Uses indexed fields
SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE CreatedDate = TODAY

-- Avoid: Non-selective queries
SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Name LIKE '%Inc%'
```

**Limit Result Sets**
```sql
-- Always use LIMIT for large datasets
SELECT Id, Name FROM Contact LIMIT 100
```

**Efficient Field Selection**
```sql
-- Good: Only select needed fields
SELECT Id, Name, Email FROM Contact

-- Avoid: Select all fields
SELECT Id, Name, Email, Phone, ... FROM Contact
```

### Data Management

**Validate Before Creating**
1. Use `salesforce_describe` to understand field requirements
2. Check for existing records to avoid duplicates
3. Validate data formats (emails, phones, dates)

**Handle Errors Gracefully**
1. Check error messages for field validation failures
2. Use describe tool to understand field constraints
3. Validate picklist values before creation

**Maintain Data Quality**
1. Regular cleanup of test data
2. Consistent naming conventions
3. Proper use of required vs optional fields

### Security Considerations

**Field-Level Security**
- Respect Salesforce field-level security settings
- Check if fields are createable/updateable before operations
- Handle permission errors appropriately

**Data Access**
- Only query data you need access to
- Respect sharing rules and record visibility
- Use appropriate SOQL filters

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Query Issues

**"Field not found" Error**
- Use API field names, not labels
- Check spelling and case sensitivity
- Use describe tool to get correct field names

**"Object not found" Error**
- Verify object API name spelling
- Check if object exists in your org
- Use empty describe to list available objects

### Create/Update Issues

**"Required field missing" Error**
- Use describe tool to identify required fields
- Provide all required fields in data object
- Check for validation rules requiring additional fields

**"Insufficient access" Error**
- Verify user has create/edit permissions
- Check field-level security settings
- Ensure sharing rules allow access

### Performance Issues

**Slow Query Response**
- Add selective WHERE clauses
- Use LIMIT to restrict result size
- Avoid queries on non-indexed fields

**API Limit Errors**
- Monitor daily API usage in Salesforce
- Optimize queries to use fewer API calls
- Consider bulk operations for large datasets
